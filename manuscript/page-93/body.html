And I don't like the way fellows do either, in this country."</p><p>"What do you like?"</p><p>"To live in Italy, and to enjoy myself in my own way."</p><p>Jo wanted very much to ask what his own way was, but his black brows looked rather threatening as he knit them, so she changed the subject by saying, as her foot kept time, "That's a splendid polka!
