Touching, isn't it?" answered Jo scornfully.</p><p>"Don't say my John, it isn't proper or true," but Meg's voice lingered over the words as if they sounded pleasant to her. "Please don't plague me, Jo, I've told you I don't care much about him, and there isn't to be anything said, but we are all to be friendly, and go on as before."</p><p>"We can't, for something has been said, and Laurie's mischief has spoiled you for me.

I hate to wait, so if you mean ever to do it, make haste and have it over quickly," said Jo pettishly.</p></div> </div>
