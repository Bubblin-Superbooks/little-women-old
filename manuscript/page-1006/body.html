I fancy he has a hard life of it. Mrs. Kirke asked me if I wouldn't go down to the five o'clock dinner, and feeling a little bit homesick, I thought I would, just to see what sort of people are under the same roof with me.

She gave me a seat by her, and after my face cooled off, I plucked up courage and looked about me.</p></div> </div>
