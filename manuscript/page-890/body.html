Mrs. Chester asked me if I would, and I offered to tend a table, as I have nothing but my time to give."</p><p>"I'm not," put in Jo decidedly.

It's for the freedmen as well as the Chesters, and I think it very kind of them to let me share the labor and the fun. Patronage does not trouble me when it is well meant."</p></div> </div>
