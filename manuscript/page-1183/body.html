Demi, go upstairs, and get into your bed, as Mamma bids you."</p><p>"S'ant!" replied the young rebel, helping himself to the coveted 'cakie', and beginning to eat the same with calm audacity.</p><p>"You must never say that to Papa. I shall carry you if you don't go yourself."</p><p>"Go 'way, me don't love Parpar." and Demi retired to his mother's skirts for protection.</p><p>But even that refuge proved unavailing, for he was delivered over to the enemy, with a "Be gentle with him, John," which struck the culprit with dismay, for when Mamma deserted him, then the judgment day was at hand.
