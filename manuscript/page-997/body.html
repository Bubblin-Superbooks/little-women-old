When I lost sight of Father's dear old face, I felt a trifle blue, and might have shed a briny drop or two, if an Irish lady with four small children, all crying more or less, hadn't diverted my mind, for I amused myself by dropping gingerbread nuts over the seat every time they opened their mouths to roar.</p><p>Soon the sun came out, and taking it as a good omen, I cleared up likewise and enjoyed my journey with all my heart.</p></div> </div>
