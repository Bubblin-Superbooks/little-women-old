And I can only stay home and knit, like a poky old woman!"</p><p>And Jo shook the blue army sock till the needles rattled like castanets, and her ball bounded across the room.</p><p>"Poor Jo! It's too bad, but it can't be helped. So you must try to be contented with making your name boyish, and playing brother to us girls," said Beth, stroking the rough head with a hand that all the dish washing and dusting in the world could not make ungentle in its touch.</p></div> </div>
