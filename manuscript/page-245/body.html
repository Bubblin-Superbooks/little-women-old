<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"My good mother used to help me..."</p><p>"As you do us..." interrupted Jo, with a grateful kiss.</p><p>"But I lost her when I was a little older than you are, and for years had to struggle on alone, for I was too proud to confess my weakness to anyone else. I had a hard time, Jo, and shed a good many bitter tears over my failures, for in spite of my efforts I never seemed to get on. Then your father came, and I was so happy that I found it easy to be good. But by-and-by, when I had four little daughters round me and we were poor, then the old trouble began again, for I am not patient by nature, and it tried me very much to see my children wanting anything."</p></div> </div>
