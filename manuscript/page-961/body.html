I'm sure there is something on her mind, and I want you to discover what it is."</p><p>"What makes you think so, Mother?"</p><p>"She sits alone a good deal, and doesn't talk to her father as much as she used. I found her crying over the babies the other day. When she sings, the songs are always sad ones, and now and then I see a look in her face that I don't understand. This isn't like Beth, and it worries me."</p></div> </div>
