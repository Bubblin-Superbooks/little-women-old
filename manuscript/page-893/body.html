I'm very stupid about studying anything, can't bear French, it's such a slippery, silly sort of language," was the brusque reply.</p><p>Another look passed between the ladies, and Aunt March said to Amy, "You are quite strong and well now, dear, I believe? Eyes don't trouble you any more, do they?"</p><p>"Not at all, thank you, ma'am.
