It will be such a help to Laurie, for I can row, and Meg see to the lunch, and the children be useful in some way."</p><p>"I hope the Vaughns are not fine grown-up people. Do you know anything about them, Jo?" asked Meg.</p><p>"Only that there are four of them. Kate is older than you, Fred and Frank (twins) about my age, and a little girl (Grace), who is nine or ten. Laurie knew them abroad, and liked the boys. I fancied, from the way he primmed up his mouth in speaking of her, that he didn't admire Kate much."</p></div> </div>
