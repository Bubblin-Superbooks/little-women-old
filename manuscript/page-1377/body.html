I want to see it go wound."</p><p>"I can't do that any more than you could open the watch. God winds you up, and you go till He stops you."</p><p>"Does I?" and Demi's brown eyes grew big and bright as he took in the new thought. "Is I wounded up like the watch?"</p><p>"Yes, but I can't show you how, for it is done when we don't see."</p></div> </div>
