<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> You go to Aunt March's, and I'll come and take you out every day, driving or walking, and we'll have capital times. Won't that be better than moping here?"</p><p>"I don't wish to be sent off as if I was in the way," began Amy, in an injured voice.</p><p>"Bless your heart, child, it's to keep you well. You don't want to be sick, do you?"</p><p>"No, I'm sure I don't, but I dare say I shall be, for I've been with Beth all the time."</p><p>"That's the very reason you ought to go away at once, so that you may escape it. Change of air and care will keep you well, I dare say, or if it does not entirely, you will have the fever more lightly. I advise you to be off as soon as you can, for scarlet fever is no joke, miss."</p></div> </div>
