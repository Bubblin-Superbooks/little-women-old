It is more sweet to me than I can tell. Say 'thou', also, and I shall say your language is almost as beautiful as mine."</p><p>"Isn't 'thou' a little sentimental?" asked Jo, privately thinking it a lovely monosyllable.</p><p>"Sentimental? Yes. Thank Gott, we Germans believe in sentiment, and keep ourselves young mit it. Your English 'you' is so cold, say 'thou', heart's dearest, it means so much to me," pleaded Mr. Bhaer, more like a romantic student than a grave professor.</p></div> </div>
