<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Pooh! You're a girl, and it's fun, but I'll allow no man to shake me!"</p><p>"I don't think anyone would care to try it, if you looked as much like a thundercloud as you do now. Why were you treated so?"</p><p>"Just because I wouldn't say what your mother wanted me for. I'd promised not to tell, and of course I wasn't going to break my word."</p><p>"Couldn't you satisfy your grandpa in any other way?"</p><p>"No, he would have the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I'd have told my part of the scrape, if I could without bringing Meg in. As I couldn't, I held my tongue, and bore the scolding till the old gentleman collared me. Then I bolted, for fear I should forget myself."</p></div> </div>
